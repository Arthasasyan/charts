# Aggregators

Charts Syntax supports aggregation functions for inline computation that does not modify underlying data.

| Syntax | Description
|--- |--- |
| <a name="count"></a>[`count`](#count) | **Number** of samples during the period. |
<a name="min"></a>[`min`](#min) | **Minimum value** during the period. |
<a name="max"></a>[`max`](#max) | **Maximum value** during the period. |
<a name="sum"></a>[`sum`](#sum) | **Sum** of values during the period. |
<a name="avg"></a>[`avg`](#avg) | **Average value** during the period. |
<a name="percentile"></a>[`percentile(n)`](#percentile)| `n`-th [percentile](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/data/aggregation.html#percentile), for example `PERCENTILE(75)` or `PERCENTILE(99.5)`.<br>`n` is a decimal number between `(0, 100]`.<br>Default `n = 50`.|
<a name="median"></a>[`median`](#median) | Median value, same as 50% percentile. |
<a name="standard-deviation"></a>[`standard-deviation`](#standard-deviation) | **Standard deviation** of values during the period.<br>Square root of the variance. |
<a name="first"></a>[`first`](#first) | **First** value received during the period. |
<a name="last"></a>[`last`](#last) | **Last** value received during the period. |
<a name="delta"></a>[`delta`](#delta) | **Delta** is the difference between the last value in the period and the last value in the previous period.<br>If no last value is present in the previous period, then `delta` is the difference between the last and first values during the current period.<br>See also [`counter`](#counter) aggregator. |
<a name="counter"></a>[`counter`](#counter) | Sum of the differences between consecutive values in the period.<br>If the difference between any two values is negative, the difference is replaced with the value itself.<br>If the difference between values is always non-negative, the `counter` aggregator returns the same value as the `delta` aggregator.<br>Refer to this [**Example**](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/86c6b6e0) to better understand the difference between `COUNTER` and `DELTA`. |
<a name="wtavg"></a>[`wtavg`](#wtavg) | An **average** created via the multiplication of each component by a factor reflecting importance.<br>Weight is assigned **based on timestamps** rather than index.<br>Data points with older timestamps contribute less to the weighted mean than more recent data.<br>The weight of a sample is proportional to the `current_time – first_time + 1` (in seconds), where `current_time` is the timestamp of the sample, and `first_time` is the timestamp of the first sample received during the period.<br>Weights are normalized, their sum is equal to `1`.<br>Refer to the [calculation example](#avg-wavg-and-wtavg-example) below. |
<a name="wavg"></a>[`wavg`](#wavg) | A **weighted average** of samples received during the period.<br>The weight of a sample is proportional to the index of the sample in the time-ordered array of all samples during the period.<br>Weights are normalized, their sum is equal to `1`.<br>A weighted average is sum of sample values multiplied by weight.<br>Refer to the [**Calculation Example**](#avg-wavg-and-wtavg-example) below. |
<a name="min-value-time"></a>[`min_value_time`](#min-value-time) | **Time** when the minimum value ([`min`](#min)) occurred during the period. |
<a name="max-value-time"></a>[`max_value_time`](#max-value-time) | **Time** when the maximum value ([`max`](#max)) occurred during the period. |
<a name="threshold-count"></a>[`threshold_count`](#threshold-count) | Number of **threshold violations** during the period.<br>A violation is a sequence of one or more successive data points exceeding the specified threshold.<br>**Example**: The following values are collected every `5` minutes.<br>`1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 1`. <br>If the threshold is set to `4`, then one sequence (`5`,`7`) exceeds the threshold. |
<a name="threshold-duration"></a>[`threshold_duration`](#threshold-duration) | **Total duration** of threshold violations during the period in **milliseconds**.<br>A violation is a sequence of one or more successive data points exceeding the specified threshold.<br>**Example**: The following values are collected every `5` minutes.<br>`1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 1`.<br>If the threshold is set to `4`, then one sequence (`5`,`7`) exceeds the threshold and its total duration based on linear interpolation is `550` seconds.<br>If the threshold is `5`, then duration is `850` seconds.<br>For periods at the beginning of the timespan, at the end of the timespan or after a missing period, the value at the beginning of the period is set to the first value, and the value at the end of the period is set to last value. |
<a name="threshold-percent"></a>[`threshold-percent`](#threshold-percent) | **Percent** of time during which the value remained below threshold (no violation).<br>Formula: `threshold_percent = 100 - threshold_duration / period_duration * 100` |

## Interpolation Functions

If the period does not contain any detailed values, they are excluded from the results. Aggregator behavior can be modified by specifying an interpolation function.

|Function |Description |
|--- |--- |
<a name="none"></a>[`NONE`](#none) |No interpolation. Periods without any raw values are excluded from results. |
<a name="linear"></a>[`LINEAR`](#linear) |Calculate period value using linear interpolation between previous and next period values. |
<a name="previous"></a>[`PREVIOUS`](#previous) |Set value for the period based on the previous period’s value. |
<a name="next"></a>[`NEXT`](#next) |Set value for the period based on the next period’s value. |
<a name="value"></a>[`VALUE`](#value) |Set value for the period to a specific number. |

> `NONE` is the default interpolation setting.

## `AVG`, `WAVG`, and `WTAVG` Example

See the Excel spreadsheet for testing and calculation.

[![](./images/avg_calculations.png)](./resources/aggregators.xlsx)

[`wtavg()`](#wtavg): Weighted time average.

Calculation: `Weight = (sample.time - first.time)/(last.time - first.time + 1)`

## Aggregation Examples

| --- | --- | --- |
| `2015-09-10 10:00:00` | `11` | `first = 11` `delta = 0` |
| `2015-09-10 11:00:00` | `9` | `min = 9 | min_value_time = 2015-09-10 11:00:00` `delta = -2` |
| `2015-09-10 12:00:00` | `14` | `delta = 5` |
| `2015-09-10 13:00:00` | `19` | `delta = 5` |
| `2015-09-10 14:00:00` | `21` | `max = 21 | max_value_time = 2015-09-10 14:00:00` `delta = 2` |
| `2015-09-10 15:00:00` | `15` | `delta = -6` |
| `2015-09-10 16:00:00` | `14` | `delta = -1` |
| `2015-09-10 17:00:00` | `11` | `delta = -3` |
| `2015-09-10 18:00:00` | `16` | `delta = 5` |
| `2015-09-10 19:00:00` | `14` | `delta = -2` |
| `2015-09-10 20:00:00` | `13` | `last = 13` `delta = -1` |

## Aggregators

* Threshold is `20`.
* Period is set to `11 hours` to includes the complete data set.

> Period `starttime` is inclusive and `endtime` is exclusive:
> * `startime = 2015-09-14 10:00:00` includes data points occurring exactly at `10:00:00` and later.<br>
> * `Endtime = 2015-09-14 11:00:00` includes data points occurring up to `10:59:59`, excluding points that occurred at `11:00:00` and later.
